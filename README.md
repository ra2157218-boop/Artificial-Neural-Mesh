## 📘 Overview

**Artificial Neural Mesh (ANM)** is a proposed cognitive architecture designed to overcome the limitations of monolithic LLM systems. Instead of relying on a single model for every domain, ANM uses a network of **specialized LLMs** coordinated by a Router and safeguarded by a Verifier.

It introduces:

* Modular multi-model intelligence
* Parallel reasoning using *Web‑of‑Thoughts (WoT)*
* Domain-specialized experts
* A Refiner + Verifier pipeline for reliability
* Long‑term episodic memory
* Controlled self‑expansion (safe autonomous fine‑tuning)

ANM is **not AGI**, but a **first practical step** toward flexible, safe distributed intelligence.

## 🧠 Architecture Summary

### **1. Router LLM**

* Understands tasks
* Splits into subtasks
* Selects specialists
* Loads memory
* Orchestrates the entire mesh

### **2. Specialist LLMs**

Independently fine‑tuned models specializing in:

* Vision
* Coding
* Logic & Mathematics
* Research
* Planning
* Tool Execution
* Safety Evaluation

### **3. Web‑of‑Thoughts (WoT)**

Parallel multi‑model communication enabling specialists to:

* Exchange reasoning
* Cross‑verify outputs
* Merge logical chains
* Debate and refine

### **4. Refiner**

* Merges outputs from specialists
* Removes contradictions
* Enhances clarity and structure

### **5. Verifier**

The final gatekeeper:

* Ensures logical correctness
* Ensures factual accuracy
* Enforces safety and alignment
* Blocks harmful or incorrect outputs

### **6. Episodic Memory**

Vector‑based memory storing:

* past tasks
* reasoning chains
* images, code, events
* user preferences

### **7. Expansion Engine**

A controlled self‑evolution module:

* Detects missing capabilities
* Builds clean datasets
* Fine‑tunes new specialists
* Integrates them safely
* Requires human approval for additional expansion

## 🔒 Safety Framework

ANM includes multi‑layer safety:

1. Router‑level pre‑checks
2. Specialist‑level constraints
3. Global Verifier (final approval)
4. Human‑in‑the‑loop oversight

Hard limits prevent AGI‑like runaway behavior:

* No recursive self‑improvement
* No model weight merging
* No cross‑node or cloud expansion
* Single‑machine constraint
* Memory cannot modify weights
* Strict computational boundaries

## 🧩 Use Cases

* Multi‑agent software engineering
* Scientific research & mathematics
* Safe autonomous task agents
* Multimodal analysis (vision + logic + code)
* Personal AI assistants
* Education & tutoring systems
* Robotics reasoning pipeline
* AI architecture experimentation
