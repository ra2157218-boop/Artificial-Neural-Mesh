# Contributing to Artificial Neural Mesh (ANM)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Artificial Neural Mesh (ANM)** — an ambitious research project exploring the next evolution of modular, multi-model intelligence systems.

ANM is currently in **early-stage research** (v1.0). We are building toward a prototype implementation (v2.0) that will demonstrate:

* Router–Specialist orchestration
* Web-of-Thought (WoT) reasoning
* Multi-agent collaboration
* Episodic memory integration
* Refinement + Verification pipelines
* Safe controlled self-expansion

If you are a researcher, engineer, student, or enthusiast interested in AGI architectures, multi-agent systems, or cognitive design — your contributions are welcome.

## 🌟 Vision

ANM aims to explore a new cognitive architecture where intelligence emerges through **cooperation** instead of monolithic models.

This is not a race to build AGI. This is a research effort focused on:

* Safe modular intelligence
* Transparency in reasoning
* Reliability through specialization
* Long-term contextual memory
* Ethics-first expansion

If you share this vision, ANM is a place where you can contribute meaningfully.
